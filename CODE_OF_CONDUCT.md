# Libreca Code of Conduct
_Adapted from the Contributor Covenant v2.1_

Libreca’s mission is to build people‑centered, open, and inclusive software.  
Our community embraces diversity of **gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, ability, belief, nationality, and class**. We reject all forms of bigotry, fascism, and harassment.

## 1 · Our Values

- **Solidarity** – We lift each other up and share knowledge freely.  
- **Respect** – No harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.  
- **Accessibility** – We design and communicate so everyone can participate.  
- **Transparency** – Decisions and finances are public.  
- **Fun & Meme‑friendliness** – Humor is welcome, never at someone’s expense.

## 2 · Expected Behavior

- Use welcoming, inclusive language; honor names and pronouns.  
- Assume positive intent, but acknowledge impact over intent.  
- Give and accept constructive feedback gracefully.  
- Help foster a harassment‑free experience for everyone.

## 3 · Unacceptable Behavior

- Violence, threats, or encouraging self‑harm.  
- Discriminatory jokes or slurs (racist, sexist, transphobic, ableist, etc.).  
- Sexualized language or unwelcome advances.  
- Trolling, flaming, or deliberate disruption.  
- “Tech‑bro” gatekeeping or belittling newcomers.  
- Unauthorized commercial use of Libreca trademarks or branding.

## 4 · Scope

This Code applies to all Libreca spaces — GitHub repos, Discussions, Discord, social media, conferences, and in‑person events — **as well as private communications that impact the project**.

## 5 · Enforcement

- **Maintainer Responsibility** – Core maintainers enforce this Code fairly and consistently.  
- Reports of violations can be sent **privately** to _Pedro Brito <pedrotirb@icloud.com>_.  
- Maintainers will review and respond within **120 hours**.  
- Actions may include warnings, PR review suspension, temporary or permanent bans, or trademark revocation for bad‑faith forks.

## 6 · Reporting Guide

When reporting, include (if safe to share):

1. Your contact info (optional for anonymity).  
2. Names of people involved.  
3. When & where the incident occurred.  
4. What happened; any relevant links or screenshots.  
5. Whether the incident is ongoing.

## 7 · Appeals

If you feel an action was unfair, email the Enforcement Team with the subject **“Appeal – Libreca CoC”**. Another maintainer uninvolved in the first decision will review.

## 8 · Acknowledgements

This Code draws from the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), the LGBTQIA+ tech community guidelines, and antifascist principles.
