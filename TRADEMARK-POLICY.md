# Libreca™ Trademark & Branding Policy

Libreca™ and the bee/star logo 🐝 are trademarks owned by Pedro Brito.

We want the Libreca ecosystem to be open, remixable, and fun — but we also want to protect users from confusion and ensure the identity of Libreca is consistent and respected.

---

## ✅ What you **can** do:

- Use the name **Libreca** when referring to the official project or giving it proper credit.
- Say your tool "is based on Libreca" or "works with Libreca".
- Use our modules' names (Ludix, Spectra, etc.) if you're building on top of them — with attribution.
- Use the bee/star logo **unmodified** to link to our website or GitHub page.

---

## 🚫 What you **cannot** do:

- Use the name **Libreca** for your own fork or product **without approval**.
- Use the bee/star logo or visual branding to represent a **modified** or commercial version.
- Claim official partnership, sponsorship, or endorsement **unless agreed in writing**.

## 🤝 Commercial Use & White-Labeling

You may not sell, re-brand, or bundle Libreca for profit **unless you are part of the Libreca core team** or have signed a commercial license agreement.

We’re happy to discuss partnerships — reach out to: **pedrotirb@icloud.com**

## 💜 Respect & Community

We trust you to respect the spirit of this policy — openness, clarity, and user freedom — while preserving the Libreca identity for everyone.
